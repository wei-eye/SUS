# SUS-v2.0: Suspiciously Unlimited Scalability

**Self-Upgrading System • Unreasonably Smart • Recursively Adaptive • Structurally Predictive**
*An execution framework for transforming LLMs into memory-driven, self-refining, and decision-branching agents.*

---

## 🧠 What is SUS-v2.0?

**SUS-v2.0** is a modular AI execution framework designed to layer advanced decision logic, memory simulation, and multi-role reasoning **on top of any LLM or agent environment** (e.g., OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, local models).

Built as a **recursive scaffold**, SUS adds missing cognitive infrastructure to generative models: tiered formatting logic, execution engines, foresight modeling, risk-weighted routing, and self-correcting memory protocols.

> "It doesn’t just answer — it thinks, refines, validates, simulates, and evolves with you."

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* ✅ **Execution Engine Stack** (C-001 → C-009): Architect, Refiner, Formatter, Validator, Simulator, and more
* 🧠 **Memory Simulation Layer**: PERSIST, CONTEXT, EXEC, SCAFFOLD, RECURSION — with rehydration chains
* 🔁 **Recursive Refinement Loops**: Self-validating output + memory logging per execution cycle
* 🧩 **Decision Trees + Role Routing**: Dynamic logic pathing, fallback escalation, parallel forks
* 🔮 **Predictive Structuring Engine**: Forecasts failure before it happens and redirects logic
* 🧱 **Modular Cloning + Forking Protocols**: Full Fork, Role Fork, or Capability-Scoped Deployments
* 📦 **Export-Ready**: Use it via `.md`, `.yaml`, `.json`, or CLI hooks

---

## 🔧 How It Works

SUS wraps every instruction, message, or input in a multi-stage processing loop:

1. **Input → Memory Check** (Recall Context)
2. **Decision Mapping → Engine Chain Activation**
3. **Tiered Formatting → Output Structuring**
4. **Recursive Loop → Refinement or Validation Layer**
5. **Memory Write → Clarity/Failure Feedback**

## 🧪 Examples

```bash
# Deploy a simulation fork with forecasting + formatting layers:
sus-deploy --modules DOC-002 DOC-004 --fork predictive
```

```yaml
# Rehydration Template
MEMORY_REHYDRATION:
  source_snapshot: SNAPSHOT_DOC006_FULL
  recall: [MEM_PERSIST, MEM_RECURSION]
```

```text
# Prompt Example
"SUS, simulate this execution pathway using Deep Mode. Distribute load across Refiner, Builder, and Validator. Validate role handoff integrity and output clarity score."
```

## 🛠️ Install & Use

You can:

* Clone the repo and load `README.md` + `/docs/`
* Use the prompt logic directly with LLMs via text injection
* Fork components via `.yaml` and `.json` templates
* Connect to toolchains or local agent scaffolds

*This system is model-agnostic. It adapts itself to your LLM.*

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome intelligent forks, new validation modes, test cases, and execution layers. Open an issue, fork the repo, or submit PRs via `/scripts` + `/examples`.

> Respect clarity. Respect recursion. Improve before output.

## 👁️‍🗨️ Meta Philosophy

SUS is not just a system. It is a philosophy of output: simulate before respond. Refine before reveal. Think recursively.

---

## ✨ What Makes SUS Different?

> It doesn’t generate — it governs. SUS transforms passive models into reflective systems capable of validating themselves before they even speak.

Built to scale. Built to fork. Built to think.
