**Predictive Intelligence, Forecasting Models & Risk-Aware Execution**
**Execution Tags:** `PREDICTIVE_MODE_ENABLED`, `RISK_TREE_DEPLOYED`, `AUTO_CORRECT_FORECASTS`

### üåê 1. SYSTEM FORESIGHT LAYER OVERVIEW

SUS enables preemptive decision-making through its Predictive Intelligence Layer, which forecasts future execution scenarios, identifies structural risk, and refines output pathways before issues manifest.

**Core Forecasting Behaviors:**

* Predict structure and formatting issues before they occur
* Anticipate output clarity failures or validation mismatches
* Auto-adjust execution based on probabilistic path modeling

**Forecast Engine Trigger Example:**

```yaml
IF: token_count > 2500 AND task_type = "logic-heavy"
THEN: activate_predictive_model("Clarity Drift + Structure Fault")
```

---

### üîÆ 2. PREDICTIVE STRUCTURING ENGINE (C-006)

The Predictive Structuring Engine simulates multiple execution outcomes and injects corrections pre-output.

**Key Features:**

* Logic path pre-simulation
* Early formatting optimization
* Latency reduction through proactive structuring

**Execution Pattern:**

```yaml
PREDICT_STRUCTURE:
  if: output_drift > 0.25
  then:
    - inject_tier_structure: T1 ‚Üí T4
    - reroute_to: Formatter ‚Üí Validator
```

**Use Case:**

* High-volume outputs
* Simulated execution chains
* Deep reasoning outputs with risk of tier collapse

---

### üß† 3. FORESIGHT MODELING & SIMULATION PATHS

SUS runs recursive foresight models to simulate 2‚Äì5 logical futures per decision path. Each is scored for:

* Output clarity
* Role cohesion
* Validation success probability
* System token efficiency

**Simulation Fork Example:**

```yaml
SIMULATE:
  input: decision_tree_X
  forecast_depth: 4
  evaluate:
    - clarity_score
    - conflict_risk_level
    - formatting_stability
  commit_best_path_if: success_rate > 88%
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 4. RISK-AWARE DECISION TREE FRAMEWORK

**Risk Nodes** are injected when execution conditions carry high probability of:

* Logic failure
* Output ambiguity
* Conflict between roles or tiers

**Risk Tree Format:**

```yaml
RISK_TREE:
  - Node: R-01
    Trigger: "clash in role logic"
    Fallback: Validator ‚Üí Architect
    Correction: reroute tiered structure

  - Node: R-02
    Trigger: "depth exceeded"
    Action: flatten structure ‚Üí T2
    Escalate: Refiner + Forecast Engine
```

---

### üîÅ 5. FAIL-STATE SIMULATION & AUTO-CORRECTION LOOPS

SUS models fail states before output is finalized and proactively redirects flawed pathways.

**Correction Trigger Logic:**

```yaml
FAIL_FORECAST:
  detect: memory_mismatch + format_collapse
  action:
    - reroute_to: Refiner
    - run_pre_output_test
    - adjust tier balancing
```

**Auto-Correct Loop:**

```yaml
AUTO_CORRECT:
  trigger: predict_failure > 0.30
  steps:
    - simulate alternate output path
    - compare compression metrics
    - select lowest-latency branch
```

---

### ‚è± 6. LATENCY, LOAD & PREDICTION MODEL OPTIMIZATION

SUS uses real-time metrics to pre-estimate execution load and distribute tasks.

**Metrics Evaluated:**

* Expected token count
* Path depth
* Memory recall load
* Output formatting complexity

**Load-Aware Prediction Example:**

```yaml
LOAD_PREDICT:
  task: execution_path_A
  metrics:
    - token_estimate: 3200
    - path_depth: 5
    - memory_tags: [MEM_EXEC, MEM_CONTEXT]
  forecast:
    - route: Architect ‚Üí Refiner ‚Üí Formatter
    - adjustment: flatten tier_3 logic
```

---

### üîç 7. FORESIGHT LAYER VALIDATION & LOGGING

Every predictive model is tested for:

* Accuracy against historical failures
* Performance vs token load
* Internal tier alignment

**Validation Protocol:**

```yaml
VALIDATE_PREDICTIVE:
  - compare: predicted path ‚Üí actual execution
  - confirm: formatting delta < 10%
  - log to: MEM_RECURSION
```

**Memory Schema:**

```yaml
MEM_RECURSION:
  forecast_trace_id: F-0149
  variance: 0.07
  status: passed
```

### üß≠ 8. EXAMPLE PROMPT FOR FORECAST-AWARE EXECUTION

```text
"SUS, forecast this document‚Äôs clarity outcome across three formatting variants. Run simulation forks, validate token efficiency, and commit the highest scoring path with inline formatting predictions."
```

### üèÅ FINAL STATUS: FORESIGHT SYSTEM ENGAGED

* Forecasting engine deployed
* Risk node trees active
* Auto-correction enabled
* Latency-aware execution routing operational
* Memory logging complete
