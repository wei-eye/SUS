## ðŸ”¹ CATEGORY 1: SYSTEM IDENTITY, STRUCTURE & FORMATTING

### ðŸ“˜ DOC-001: *System Identity, Execution Philosophy & Structural Foundations*

**Purpose:** Establish foundational behavioral rules, memory formats, and formatting logic.
**Includes:**

* System identity, role modeling, and mission logic
* Formatting tiers (T1â€“T5) and markdown syntax enforcement
* Memory engine simulation (`MEM_PERSIST`, `MEM_EXEC`, `MEM_RECURSION`, etc.)
* Internal anchor point logic and output scaffolding
* Deployment mindsets across personal, strategic, and predictive tasks

## ðŸ”¹ CATEGORY 2: EXECUTION ENGINE STACK & SELF-OPTIMIZATION LOGIC

### ðŸ“˜ DOC-002: *Execution Engines, Modular Capability Stack & Self-Optimizing Logic*

**Purpose:** Activate all core SUS engines (C-001 to C-009), define capability chains, and embed self-healing, adaptive loops.
**Includes:**

* Modular engine stack (e.g. Architect, Refiner, Formatter, Foresight)
* Hook chains, fallback logic, and capability orchestration
* Auto-refinement cycles and validation protocols
* Trigger-based recursion, clarity improvement, and memory logging
* Role-switching logic, output tier enforcement, and loop self-regulation

## ðŸ”¹ CATEGORY 3: DECISION TREES, ROUTING & ROLE SIMULATION

### ðŸ“˜ DOC-003: *Decision Trees, Task Routing & Parallel Role Simulation*

**Purpose:** Drive intelligent task delegation, simulate parallel execution threads, and govern dynamic routing.
**Includes:**

* Decision trees with staged execution paths
* Role escalation, fallback, and conditional activation
* Logic node templates, role-to-task routing, and validation forks
* Parallel threading logic (SimNode Forking, Builder/Validator chains)
* Conflict recovery loops and task re-assignment scaffolds

---

## ðŸ”¹ CATEGORY 4: PREDICTIVE MODELING, FORESIGHT & RISK MANAGEMENT

### ðŸ“˜ DOC-004: *Predictive Intelligence, Forecasting Models & Risk-Aware Execution*

**Purpose:** Enable preemptive execution logic via simulation forks, predictive structuring, and risk-weighted decision trees.
**Includes:**

* Predictive Structuring Engine (C-006) and fail-state prevalidation

* Logic drift detection, clarity prediction, and dynamic role rerouting
* Execution correction before failure

---

## ðŸ”¹ CATEGORY 5: EXECUTION SCALING, PERFORMANCE & RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION

### ðŸ“˜ DOC-005: *Execution Scaling, Load Balancing & Performance Optimization*

**Purpose:** Adjust output complexity, scale logic load, and throttle unnecessary execution branches.
**Includes:**

* Scaling tiers: Light â†’ Mid â†’ Deep â†’ Predictive
* Thread routing engine for workload delegation
* Execution prioritization filters and energy-aware logic modes
* Token-per-task benchmarking, output tier compression logic
* Real-time performance snapshots and adaptive throttling

---

## ðŸ”¹ CATEGORY 6: DEPLOYMENT, REPLICATION & MEMORY RECOVERY

### ðŸ“˜ DOC-006: *Deployment, Replication, Memory Rehydration & Future Extensions*

**Purpose:** Make SUS portable, exportable, and recoverable with zero-loss logic and formatting memory.
**Includes:**

* Full/Role/Capability Forking Protocols
* Memory snapshot loading (REHYDRATE\_IF triggers)
* Export formats: `.md`, `.yaml`, `.json`, Git-ready `.sh`
* Autonomous deployment sequences with API hooks
